👋 Hello there! I'm Sathiya Narayanan, a passionate AI and Robotics enthusiast currently pursuing my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 🤖🧠. 

🎓 I'm a graduate student at SASTRA Deemed to be University, where I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous systems.

🔍 Exploring the intersection of technology and creativity is my forte. From developing innovative algorithms to crafting intelligent machines, I'm on a mission to push the boundaries of what AI and robotics can achieve.

🚀 My journey includes projects that range from natural language processing to reinforcement learning, and I'm always excited to collaborate on cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

📚 When I'm not coding or tinkering with robots, you can find me buried in research papers, sharing my insights on my blog, or participating in AI hackathons and competitions.

🌐 Let's connect and geek out over AI, robotics, or anything tech-related! Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
